# Training AI to play the game For Sale by Stefan Dorra

For Sale is a bidding game first published in 1997 where players buy and sell real estate. The game is played in two distinct phases.[^1] In phase one, players each have a set number of coins to spend on properties. In turn order, players are allowed to place the next bid in the auction or pass. Players who pass are given back half of any coins they had previously bid.[^2] Players who pass are given the lowest value property until the final player remaining receives the best property. This cycle repeats until all properties are bought. In the selling phase, a number of checks equal to the number of players is displayed. Players secretly select one of their properties to sell, and checks are distributed based on the printed value of the properties. This cycle repeats until all properties are sold. 



[^1]: It is somewhat rare for games to have this distinct phase split, and for such a simple game, it adds a great thematic arc. Check out this design doc by Arcs and Root designer Cole Wehrle where he explains the difference in types of temporality in board games. The distinct phase split is similar to Brass and is the second type of temporality discussed in the article.  https://ledergames.com/blogs/news/arcs-designer-diary-4-two-types-of-time-in-arcs

[^2]: Historically, the game has had different rules on if it should be rounded up or rounded down. There is even ambiguity on the designer's original intent. I will make versions of the game that use both rules to understand differences in play. There is more money in the game if players get the money back rounded up, and I expect this difference to have a significant strategic impact. https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1532852/article/21974828#21974828
